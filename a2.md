# Put your writeup here
I solved the autocomplete problem first by starting with the add(String word) method, so I could have my initial trie built.  Starting with this method was also useful because I was able to get familiar with the properties contained within each node and the general structure of the trie.  I originally started writing add by using currentNode as my traversal node but I realized when I started the next method, advance, that currentNode is used for the traversal through the currentPrefix.  I then replaced currentNode for traverseNode in my add method to ensure that currentNode was used for the traversal through currentPrefix.  Then I started working on advance, and I originally wrote it where currentNode and currentPrefix would only update if the addition of the input character was a valid prefix.  I continued down to the next method, which was retreat, and I originally wrote it where if the currentPrefix was not null or empty, then I would simply delete the last character in currentPrefix and move back up the trie in currentNode.  I continued to go down sequentially to each method, so the next method I wrote was reset.  In reset, I simply set currentNode back to the root and the currentPrefix to empty.

Once I reached the isWord() method I looked at the methods I had left, and decided that I could write the rest of the methods, but I needed to make a change to add.  I had not kept track of the size field correctly in my add, because I was only incrementing the size when I had reached the end of the word and had set the isWord flag to true.  Adding this in made me realize that I had to add more to the case of a duplicate word because I had originally just returned false if it was a duplicate word.  I added a loop that decremented the size of all the characters in the duplicate word and continued to the method I had left off on which was isWord().  In isWord() I just checked for the isWord field in the currentNode and returned true if it was true and false otherwise.  Then I wrote add by simply calling the add(String word) method, and I placed the currentPrefix string in as the input.  Finally, I had reached the last two methods getNumberOfPredictions() and retrievePrediction().

I wrote getNumberOfPredictions() as just returning the size value in currentNode unless the root was null then I would just return zero.  Lastly, I wrote retrievePrediction() by traversing with the currentNode down to a valid word and adding those characters to the currentPrefix and returning that value.  Once I had completed all these methods I started testing my program both locally and on gradescope.  I realized that I had multiple errors and I was able to uncover my mistakes through debugging mostly with print statements.  I noticed that in advance the currentPrefix was supposed to add the input character even if it was not a valid prefix but the currentNode would not traverse outside of the trie.  This made me realize that I had incorrectly written all my methods after advance.  My solution was adding a global variable called level that checked the depth of the currentNode, so I could compare it to the length of the currentPrefix.  This allowed me to fix simple errors like in retreat where I would retreat back a letter on my currentNode and currentPrefix, even though they were not at the same character in the string.  This along with more debugging eventually led me to achieve a functional autocomplete class.

|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|                     O(1)                     | O(alphabet size*length of the current prefix) |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|           getNumberOfPredictions()           |             retrievePrediction()              |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|                     O(1)                     |            O(prediction.length())             |

I was able to achieve all the correct commented running times for each method in the AutoComplete.java class.
